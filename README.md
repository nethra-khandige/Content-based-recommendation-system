# Content-based-recommendation-system
This project gives a brief idea how Content-Based or Item-Item recommendation systems work. This technique attempts to figure out what a user's favourite aspects of an item is, and then recommends items that present those aspects. In our case, we're going to try to figure out the input's favorite genres from the movies and ratings given.
